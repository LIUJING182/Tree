# Tree

This project trains a decision tree model on the data sets from UCI machine learning repository: Breast Cancer Data and Thoracic Surgery Data. It is important to note that this training algorithm is random. Therefore, the structure of the trained tree will be different each time. Our paper chooses one of them.
